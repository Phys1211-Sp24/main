# What did we learn this semester

1. Independently write program using "it won't work the first time - but you can get there"
2. Import data
3. Mathematica, at least a little
4. Coding is challenging
5. Understanding how to use sources, setting up the problem, debugging, a little better
6. How to interpret data, graphing techniques
7. Never touched to more confident with coding, setting up problems, know more about visuals
8. Good to deal with a lot of data in a useful way
9. Interpreting data (exoplanet), filtering data.
10. Generally, systematizing classical physics problems
11. Think more efficiently, try to simplify task
12. Think logically, tried to use pseudocode to step through problem first
13. First experience learning to think programmatically, Pandas useful
14. Learned how approach problems, could be extend into other languages
15. Things always take longer, especially data wrangling
16. Importing into jupyter, calling files from other files
17. Data mining, made individualized learning easier with objectives
18.
